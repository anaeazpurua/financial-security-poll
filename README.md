Title:
Short description of what you aimed to accomplish:
My main goals  
Experiment with storytelling.
Create graphics programmatically.
Survive until the final project.


Short description of your findings:


Summary of the data collection process, with links:
I couldn’t get the raw data from the poll on time. I wouldn’t publish this in a news outlet without examining the actual poll first. However, as a class exercise I tried to scrap the data from the graphics included in this story. It seems they used an infogram embed that didn’t let me get the info. I couldn’t find an undocumented API either. 


I decided to just copy the data manually in a Google Sheets, since there were not many data points and my main objective for this project was to create a visualizations programmatically.


Overview of the data analysis process:


A section about what new skills, approaches, etc you used, or where you grew the most during the project:
- I created a bar graph in Altair
- I learned how to fix a font issue I was having when I used Roboto in my ai2html graphics. I followed Soma's tutorial at https://gist.github.com/jsoma/631621e0807b26d49f5aef5260f79162 and now I have the fonts I wanted. While I was investigating this, I also learned 


Things I tried/wanted to do but did not have the skills/time:
If I had advanced JavaScript and D3.js skills I would have built the story with both. I would have used the answer the user inputs at the beginning throughout the story to personalize it.  


Notebooks used for data collection and analysis:
Your notebooks should include some Markdown cells at the top that explain what you're doing in the notebook. Ideally you also sprinkle commentary/questions throughout the notebook.
