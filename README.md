# Half of Americans say they need more than $100,000 annually to feel financially secure, according to a poll.

### My main goals  
- Experiment with storytelling.
- Create graphics programmatically.
- Survive until the final project.

### Short description of your findings:
I couldn’t get the raw data from the poll on time. I wouldn’t publish this in a news outlet without examining the actual figures first. 

However, as a class exercise, I tried to scrap the data points from the graphics included in the Bankrate story. It seems they used an infogram embed that didn’t let me get the info. I couldn’t find an undocumented API either. I copied the data manually into Google Sheets.

### Overview of the data analysis process:
The data was small so I didn't have to do a lot of analysis, but I did include a critique on the text of my story because I believe it would have been better if Bankrate had used the median instead of the mean when describing the desired incomes.

### New skills, approaches:
- I created a bar graph in Altair. 
- I learned how to fix a font issue I was having when I used Roboto in my ai2html graphics. I followed Soma's tutorial at https://gist.github.com/jsoma/631621e0807b26d49f5aef5260f79162 and now I have the fonts I wanted.
  
### Things I tried/wanted to do but did not have the skills/time:
If I had advanced JavaScript and D3.js skills, I would have built the story with both. I would have used the answer the user inputs at the beginning throughout the story to personalize it.  
I could not embed the Vega-Altair graphic directly on my site. I tried to do it but it wouldn't display correctly. I ended up exporting it as a SVG, styling it in Illustrator, and then running the ai2html script.
